COVID PORTFOLIO PROJECT

Summary
I have extracted data from official website from 24-02-20 to 30-4-21, 2 datasets containing excel files for Deaths and vaccinations.
I have used SQL Server to explore data using Joins, CTE's, Window functions, aggregates, creating views .

2)The total death count was the maximum in Europe followed by North America and South America

3)The highest percentage population infected of the total population was in Andorra which was 17%
